Similiar Concepts:
1. both companies talk about how a code review is a discussion and that everyone should
    be respectful of one another. in that case, the companies both say to focus talk on the 
    code and not the submitter.
2. both companies also talk about how to not give major changes in the code, but to give a small
    suggestion with helpful feedback for the submitter to think about and try to implement themself.

Differences:
1. yelp talks about time is of esscence, so to focus more on that than a really well thought out review
    which is what microsoft suggests.
2. yelp seems to get more to the point of where the code is wrong while microsoft emphasizes to watch the
    tone of the response. yelp wants to get to the core of the problem while microsoft focuses on how 
    to be respectful.

good example: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/287927/rock-paper-scissors-game
    this is a good example because the reviewer breaks the problem into sections and explains thoroughly
    what the submitter needs to do and understand in order to implement it correctly.

bad example: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/287926/iterate-internal-array-for-a-vba-class
    although the reviwer does a good job trying to explain what the submitter needs to do, they are essentially
    recoding the person's work, which is why I think it is a bad review.
